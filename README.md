# Penny-plan
A smart, structured, and gamified micro-saving platform to build consistent saving habits.
Many individuals, particularly students and young earners, lack consistent saving habits due to limited financial awareness and absence of structured tools.
Existing saving methods often seem complex, resulting in irregular savings and unmet financial goals.
This highlights the need for a simple, systematic, and trackable solution to make saving accessible and sustainable for everyone.
